Challenge Objective<br>
For the Maven Coffee Challenge, you'll play the role of an Analytics Consultant hired by a group of investors looking to break into the US coffee market. They would like to leverage insights from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test", but lack the analytical skills to do so. That's where you come in!

You've been asked to share an explanatory report providing a data-driven strategy for opening their first coffee shop. The investors expressed interest in the following areas, but are open to any additional insights and recommendations you can provide:
<br>
Target audience: What type of customer should we target, and what are their preferences? <br>
Product offering: What types of coffee beans and drinks should we offer?<br>
Pricing strategy: How can we align prices with customer value perception?<br>

Based on the analysis of consumer preferences from “The Great American Coffee Taste Test,” several key insights can guide the product offering strategy for the coffee shop:
<br>
Caffeine Preference: The majority of respondents prefer full-caffeine coffee.<br>
Strength Level: There is a preference for strong coffee.<br>
Preferred Coffee: The favorite coffee drink among respondents is Pourover.<br>
Roast Level: Respondents tend to prefer light roast coffee.<br>
Pre-testing Coffee Preference: Respondents lean towards fruity coffee flavors.<br>
The coffee shop should concentrate on providing a range of full-caffeine alternatives, with a focus on strong coffee blends, on these tastes. Emphasizing Pourover as a well-liked option can draw in clients looking for this particular brew. These tastes can be satisfied by providing options for light-roasting coffee.

Pricing Strategy

Price Range: Since the highest monthly spending and maximum willingness to pay for coffee fall within the $20-$40 and $8-$10 ranges, respectively, the coffee shop should focus on offering a range of high-quality, premium coffee options within these price points.
<br>
Equipment Value: Consumers who have spent over $1000 in the last five years value their coffee equipment. To take advantage of this, the coffee shop can sell premium coffee equipment, such as espresso machines, coffee grinders, and brewing accessories, to help customers enjoy better coffee at home.<br>
Consumers are prepared to spend $8–$10 on a cup of coffee, suggesting that they value quality. The coffee shop’s prices should reflect the value that customers see in them; base selections should be priced competitively, while premium offerings should be slightly more expensive.

Recommendations:
<br>
Targeted Marketing: Focus marketing campaigns on the 25–34 age range, emphasizing hip and cutting-edge coffee selections. <br>
Diverse Product Offering: To accommodate varying tastes within the target market, provide a selection of coffee flavors and brewing techniques.<br>
Convenience for Home Workers: Provide easy-to-make or single-serve coffee pod options for customers who primarily work from home.
