Price Range: Since the highest monthly spending and maximum willingness to pay for coffee fall within the $20-$40 and $8-$10 ranges, respectively, the coffee shop should focus on offering a range of high-quality, premium coffee options within these price points.

Equipment Value: Consumers who have spent over $1000 in the last five years value their coffee equipment. To take advantage of this, the coffee shop can sell premium coffee equipment, such as espresso machines, coffee grinders, and brewing accessories, to help customers enjoy better coffee at home.
Consumers are prepared to spend $8–$10 on a cup of coffee, suggesting that they value quality. The coffee shop’s prices should reflect the value that customers see in them; base selections should be priced competitively, while premium offerings should be slightly more expensive.

Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing: Focus marketing campaigns on the 25–34 age range, emphasizing hip and cutting-edge coffee selections.
Diverse Product Offering: To accommodate varying tastes within the target market, provide a selection of coffee flavors and brewing techniques.
Convenience for Home Workers: Provide easy-to-make or single-serve coffee pod options for customers who primarily work from home.
